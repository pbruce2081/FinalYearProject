# FinalYearProject
## Summary
As part of my undergraduate degree at Royal Holloway, I completed a final year project within the field of game theory. 

## Algorithms for Economics and Social Choice
I used game theory algorithms, such as The Battle of the Sexes and Prisoner's Dilemma, to provide a solution to the industrial strike action. I also developed an algorithm using Polymatrix Games to simulate the conflicts between multiple parties.

## Tech Stack (Python)
* NumPy
* NetworkX
* MatPlotLib
* Tkinter

## How To Run
Ensure that you have [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/), [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/install.html), and [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html) installed.

In your command line, run the following command: `python3 app.py`.
**PLEASE NOTE: you may need to run `python app.py` instead.**
