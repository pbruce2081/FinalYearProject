# FinalYearProject
As part of my undergraduate degree at Royal Holloway, I completed a final year project within the field of game theory. My project is titled 'Algorithms for Economics and Social Choice', in which I used game theory algorithms, such as The Battle of the Sexes and Polymatrix Games, to provide a solution to the industrial strike action.
