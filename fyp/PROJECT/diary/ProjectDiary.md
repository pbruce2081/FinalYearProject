# Project Diary

## September 2022
### 19/09/2022
Today is the official start date of the project. I started doing some more in depth research into what I want my project to focus on. I was going to work with Game Theory and Blockchain technologies, however, I realised this would be very difficult to do with the lack of resources and experts within the department for me to discuss this with. 

### 20/09/2022
Today I spent time doing some more research into my finalised topic. I am leaning more towards using Nash Equilibria and two-player games. 

### 21/09/2022
I finished my initial research and have decided to base my project on the Battle of the Sexes and using that to create an algorithm to solve the issues being caused in the rail industry, for example, by disagreements over pay.

I also started writing my abstract for this finalised idea.

### 22/09/2022
I continued to work on my abstract and have started to create my GANTT chart, Trello board and initial project roadmap.

### 23/09/2022
I finished up my abstract and project roadmap. I am still working on my GANTT chart, which I decided to split per term (including breaks) instead of doing one big one as per term is more manageable.

### 27/09/2022
I set up a meeting with my supervisor (Eduard) to discuss my project idea and plan. I also will use this meeting to discuss how to properly write my risk assessment.

I also continued to work on my GANTT chart and started to write up my Roadmap & Project Plan section of the project plan document.

### 29/09/2022
Today I had a meeting with Eduard to discuss the intial plan I have written. I was advised to start doing Proof of Concept programs during Term 1. Overall the meeting was very informative and I am feeling positive about my project.

## October 2022
### 03/10/2022
Today I finished up my project plan and also properly set up my GitLab for the project.

### 06/10/2022
I have spent some time trying to fix some issues I have been having with committing to my GitLab repository. I have also spent some time polishing my project plan.

### 10/10/2022
Today I started researching for my project. I spent time looking into Nash Equilibrium and doing some questions on it to further my understanding.

### 13/10/2022
I started looking into Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium as this is something I will have to use for my project.

### 17/10/2022
Today I continued my research, applying what I have already learned to The Battle of the Sexes problem and looked further into it. I have found some interesting resources on this topic. 

### 20/10/2022
I continued to look into Battle of the Sexes to make sure I fully understand it before proceeding with my project.

### 24/10/2022
I finally managed to fix my issues with GitLab and have committed my diary. I started researching about union pay issues.

### 27/10/2022
Today I spent some time looking at Algorithmic Game Theory and some basic algorithms that are available to get some ideas on what I will need to program later in my project.

## November 2022
### 01/11/2022
I have continued to look into Algorithmic Game Theory (and may need to spend additional time outside of my research period on it) to gain a better understanding. I have also been researching union pay disputes alongside this.

### 03/11/2022
After my meeting with my supervisor yesterday, I started looking into Polymatrix Coordination Games to push myself with my project. It's definitely something I am aiming to add to my project! 

Beside doing more research, I have been trying to solve some issues I have been having trying to install the NashPy package on my laptop. I am hoping it will work on my desktop (which I am trying to do currently). If not, I may have to look further to see if any other languages have a similar package which may be useful for my project (I haven't fully settled on a language yet luckily).

### 09/11/2022
I have been finishing up my research on industrial strike action in different industries. I am now moving on to create more proof of concept programs using NashPy. I will also be starting my interim report soon. 

### 15/11/2022
Due to having a lot of coursework for my other modules, I haven't had much time to work on my project, but I plan to dedicate a lot of time on Thursday and over the weekend to catching up on project work.

### 17/11/2022 
Today I continued developing my POC programs and playing around with NashPy. I also wrote up some of my interim report.

###Â 22/11/2022
Today I worked on my interim report, writing up my research in a more suitable format than I had it in.

### 23/11/2022
I had my final meeting of the term with my supervisor. I have been working on my interim report and presentation ready for next week. I'm going to spend today looking into NetworkX as well for Polymatrix games.

### 25/11/2022
I have been playing around with NetworkX, but I have come across and error which I cannot seem to resolve so I am reaching out to my supervisor for help as I do want to use NetworkX as it is quite intuitive.

I spent a lot of yesterday writing my interim report and will continue with that today while I wait to hear back from my supervisor. 

### 29/11/2022
I completed the NetworkX tutorial and have spent time documenting my code while also writing my interim report ready for Friday. 

## December 2022
### 02/12/2022
I spent most of this week finishing up my Proof of Concept programs and writing my interim report, so today has been a bit of a slow day, with my focus mainly being on the presentation. 

Once my presentation is finished, I intend to start the design process. 

### 07/12/2022
I had my presentation today. I think it went quite well.

### 12/12/2022 
Today I started design for my final product. I am planning on doing just a basic user interface to make the data more readable than if it was only outputted in the terminal.

### 15/12/2022 
I continued designing my product and making mockups.

### 19/12/2022
I finished up my mockups and designs. Today I am planning on starting my sprint planning.

### 21/12/2022
I am continuing my sprint planning today. This will be my last day of work before Christmas.

### 28/12/2022
I have picked up with my sprint planning, but I am slightly behind schedule due to Christmas. 

## January 2023
### 03/01/2023
I am a few days behind schedule, so I am continuing to do my sprint planning, and will be updating my trello board. 

### 09/01/2023
Having gone back over my mockups, I have decided to use today to recreate them to something more realistic instead of complex, as I have made them already.

### 13/01/2023
I have finished up the redesign of my mockups and will be starting my first sprint on Monday (16/01/2023)!

### 16/01/2023
I have started my first sprint. Today I created a very basic TKinter window with a heading and a button to another page (non-functional)

### 18/01/2023
Today I finished up the basic homepage and started on the Battle of the Sexes page. Once this is done, I will link the two pages together to make the buttons functional. 

### 23/01/2023
Today was the last day of Sprint 1. I have sorted out my Trello board for the next sprint, including putting any unfinished Sprint 1 tasks into my backlog and creating the acceptance criteria for the Sprint 2 tasks. 

### 27/01/2023
I haven't done much work over the last few days due to illnes, but I intend to do more work over the weekend and dedicate Monday to mainly programming before planning my next sprint. I have come across some issues with tkinter buttons which I need to resolve, but other than that, the project is going well.

## February 2023
### 01/02/2023
Today I wrote test for my battle of the sexes algorithm and will spend time fixing the bug I have with the prisoner's dilemma page.

### 06/02/2023
I finished writing my prisoner's dilemma algorithm and its tests. I plan on starting the polymatrix games tomorrow. I have been having some issues with Tkinter buttons opening a new window, so instead of spending my time going round in circles, I have decided to complete all my backend algorithms before tackling that issue as those algorithms are more important.

### 10/02/2023
I have now created classes to create players and the polymatrix game network. Next I plan to work on creating the multiplayer game.

### 14/02/2023
I have created the multiplayer game and will be creating the polymatrix game class.

### 16/02/2023 
I have continued my work on polymatrix games and have started the polymatrix game class. I will keep working on this until the next sprint. There are some issues with calling the CreatePlayer class that I will be fixing tomorrow.

### 21/02/2023
I have now fixed the issue with importing classes I have written and aim to complete the polymatrix game part by Monday (27/02). I have also started working on my final report alongside the programming. 

### 27/02/2023
I have rewritten the polymatrix game code and tests. I now plan to go back and work on the frontend.

## March 2023
### 02/03/2023
I have updated my algorithms to allow for user input and will be implementing this on the frontend as well. 

### 07/03/2023
I have spent time writing more of my final report. I will be focussing mainly on trying to get as much of the frontend done as possible. However, if this is not possible, I have a contingency plan to use the terminal interface instead as I have been having issues with TKinter.

### 10/03/2023
I have spent some time writing my final report. I have also set up a meeting with my supervisor for next week.

### 13/03/2023
I had a brief meeting with my supervisor today where we discussed the issues I have been having with my frontend, as well as what to write for the professional issues section of my report. I then spent time doing some more of my report.

### 17/03/2023
I have spent time today fixing some issues I have been having with my frontend. I found that putting the frontend page classes into one big class has fixed a lot of my issues.

### 21/03/2023
Today I fixed issues I was having with the frontend. The Battle of the Sexes and Prisoner's Dilemma pages now output to the Tkinter windows! I am still having issues with the polymatrix game algorithm's calc_best_response function which I intend to focus on for the rest of today.

### 23/03/2023
This is the final diary entry. After days of struggling to fix the polymatrix games algorithm issue I was having with some of the functions, it is finally fixed! I will spend the rest of today making the video and finalising my report.
